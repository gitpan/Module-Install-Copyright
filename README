NAME
    Module::Install::Copyright - package a COPYRIGHT file with a
    distribution

SYNOPSIS
    In Makefile.PL:

            write_copyright_file;

DESCRIPTION
    Extracts copyright and licensing information from embedded pod and/or
    RDF metadata included in the distribution, and outputs it as a text file
    called "COPYRIGHT" which should roughly conform to the Debian copyright
    file format.

    This module provides one function for use in Module::Install-based
    Makefile.PL scripts:

    "write_copyright_file"
